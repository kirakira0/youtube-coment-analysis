      <h1>SentiCom</h1>
      <p className='paragraph'>The internet can be a beautiful place, but it can also be a breeding ground for bullying and harassment, particularly towards women, people of color, and other marginalized groups. SentiCom is a webapp which utilizes the power of Googleâ€™s Perspective API to perform sentiment analysis on the comments section of any YouTube video. We aim to provide a service through which socioanthropological and psychological researchers (or anyone interested in the power of the language we use) may easily glean useful insights on how online harassment affects content creators of different identities and demographics.</p>
